# Liquid synthetic data

This project creates synthetic data similar to CLEVR, only it supports much later versions of Blender (2.93 <= v <= 3.0.0) and allows liquid properties for the objects created.

[Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1thvwm6BochjJcTgCNSlOvbULzlSZl4q6/view?usp=sharing) you can download the dataset we used for the relations benchmark. There are 5500 samples in this link and it is about 1 giga - you can render more samples with the code if you want.
